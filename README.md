# Driver Drowsiness Detection  

This project focuses on detecting driver drowsiness in real-time to enhance road safety using machine learning and computer vision techniques.  

## Features  
- **Face and Eye Detection**: Utilizes advanced image processing techniques to locate facial landmarks and monitor eye movement.  
- **Mediapipe Cropping**: Employs MediaPipe for efficient and accurate facial feature extraction and region-of-interest cropping.  
- **Drowsiness Detection**: Analyzes eye-blink patterns and other cues to determine signs of drowsiness.  
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Processes video frames from a live feed or pre-recorded footage.  
- **Alert System**: Triggers alarms to notify the driver when drowsiness is detected.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Python**: Core programming language for development.  
- **OpenCV**: For image processing and video frame analysis.  
- **MediaPipe**: For precise cropping and facial landmark detection.  
- **Machine Learning Models**: Custom models for detecting and analyzing drowsiness indicators.  
- **Deep Learning (if applicable)**: Using frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch for enhanced accuracy.
